            <h3 class="text-primary">My Story</h3>
            <p>Hello! My name is Marlon Clay. I first got introduced to programming when I was 12 years old.
              America Online and dial-up modems were the thing. My curious little mind had stumbled upon the words, 
              "Build your own homepage", or something similar. I then spent the next few hours tinkering with 
              HTML and was able to put together a website with a bright red background and a blue link to my email address. 
              I felt very accomplised that day no matter how hard on the eyes it was to look at that page.
            </p>
            <p>Fast-forward many years and my interest in computer programming and development continued.
              I made a few fan websites dedicated to the legendary anime "Dragon Ball Z". In high school
              I made a site with a friend that featured the funniest content we could find around the internet.
              By this time, CSS had made its appearence so no more styling within the tags themselves.
            </p>
            <p>Coding was a hobby that I did for fun. I loved to learn and create with that knowledge.
              I never considered that it could be a career until this past year. I wanted to change my career
              in consumer electronics that I had been in for 8 years. A friend of mine suggested that I
              take programming up since it was something that I enjoyed doing. Shortly after, I enrolled in
              LearningFuze's Web Development program and dove head first. It was the most challenging and
              rewarding experience I've had. I learned various technologies and programming languages such as
              Javascript, jQuery, Node.js, PHP, MySQL, React and Postgres just to name a few. We were put in
              teams and completed a few 3 day hackathons and a 3 week final project. Working in those teams
              taught me so much. I loved every minute of it. Going through the AGILE and SCRUM processes
              really gave our team direction and unity. 
            </p>
            <p>I'm looking forward to further my depth of knowledge of programming and the vast possibilities
              that it offers. Creating new things and improving on others.
            </p>
